# React TODO with Hooks

The initial release of this project only used useState for state.

I have now done a major refactor in order to use useReducer and useContext.

I have considered utilizing useMemo or useCallback, but I do not think the performance benefit is worth it at this point.

## TODO

- Implement Firebase.

## Current features:

- Ant Design version 4 with the following components: Table, Row, Col, Popconfirm, Icon, Typography, Popup notification
- React Hooks (useState, useReducer and useContext)
- Add, delete and complete TODOs
- Ant Design DatePicker for date selection
- Uuid for unique React key identifier
- Pagination (multiple pages) for table
- Polyfills for IE11 support (only in production)
- Responsive layout for mobile devices
- DevOps integration with CircleCI unit testing
